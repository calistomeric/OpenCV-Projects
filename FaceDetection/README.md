# Project Description
This project detects a person's face using the algorithms available by default in opencv. This model is based on Adaboost algorithm so the expected accuracy is not quite high as expected.

# How to Use this Model
1. Put your opencv face detection model in dataset folder, and then add the name of the file using *--filename.*
2. By default the code reads camera with value 0 but if its not that case for you, you can use *--webcam* command to add the value.
3. Then run the command from terminal using **python face_detection.py --filename args --webcam args**
